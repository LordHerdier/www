# About Me ‚ú®
Hiya, I'm **Charlotte** ‚Äî a systems administrator at [Southern Illinois University Edwardsville](https://siue.edu) and a homelab enthusiast. I manage roughly 1000 devices across campus classrooms, labs, and conference rooms, handling everything from classroom tech deployment to maintaining Crestron control systems. When I'm not busy ensuring everything runs smoothly, I'm tinkering with my homelab‚Äîa mix of old computers and a couple VPSes, and pushing the limits of how many virtual machines I can host. I also enjoy reading, playing D&D, and crocheting. 

I play the clarinet and sing, and I'm currently working on a few projects that I hope to share soon.

## What I Do 

### On the Job üè¢
- **Systems Administration**: Keeping a thousand+ devices in line, ensuring students and faculty have the tools they need.
- **AV Control Systems**: Crestron and QSYS programming. I make the magic happen.
- **Server Management**: A mix of Unix/Linux and Windows Server administration, with a dash of containerization.
- **Client Support**: Helping users with their technology needs, from the simple to the complex. I'm here to help!

### Off the Clock üè†
- **Homelab Magic**: Breathing life into old hardware and VPSes, hosting more virtual machines than probably needed.
- **Creative Pursuits**: Reading, playing D&D, and working on music projects. I play clarinet with the SIUE Wind Symphony and sing in my free time.
- **Evil Machinations**: Wouldn't you like to know?

## My Skills üí™
- **Programming**: I have experience with C/C++, Crestron Simpl(+), Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripting. I also know Unity if that's your thing.

- **AV Systems**: Running board meetings, setting up classrooms, live streaming events, and more. Whatever you need, I can make it happen.
- **Server Administration**: I am primarily a Unix/Linux administrator, but have experience with Windows Server as well. Name a service, and I've probably set it up at some point. Also <3 Proxmox, my beloved.
- **Orchestration**: I have experience with Ansible, Terraform, and a growing collection of scripts to automate all the things.
- **Monitoring**: I have experience with Nagios and Prometheus/Grafana. I also have experience with SNMP, as well as setting up custom monitoring solutions.
- **Containerization**: I have extensive experience with Docker and Kubernetes, and many containers across multiple production servers. I also utilize LXCs quite a bit.
- **Networking**: I have experience with Aruba, Cisco, and Netgear networking equipment. Also VLANs, VPNs, firewalls, tailscale, and your usual networking stuff.
- **Web Development**: I'm not a web developer. I'll get it done, but don't expect anything fancy. I can definitely make a user interface for your Crestron system, though.
