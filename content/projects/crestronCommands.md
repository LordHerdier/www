# Crestron Commands

A collection of crestron's cli commands.

This is necessary because a lot of the commands are not documented and are hidden to the user.

As a Crestron engineer, I use these commands to automate the management of our AV systems.

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/LordHerdier/CrestronCommands) for more details.
