# Dotfiles
This is less of a project and more of a collection of congiuration files and tools that I use across my systeems. 
It includes my ZSH configuration, Bash scripts, nvim configuration, some ansible playbooks, and other tools I use. 

## ZSH Configuration
- Oh my Posh for prompt themes 
  - I also have several scripts to manage themes
- Custom aliases and functions for productivity 
- Other stuff for usability and convenience

## Bash Configuration
- Pretty much the same as my ZSH configuration (down to theme), but for Bash. 

## Scripts
- crestroncmd: Runner scrit for Crestron commands
- dc-respawn: Script to respawn a Docker container
- efficient: Small cli to manage SDN Efficient
- find-file: Find files in a directory with fuzzy search
- manager: Crestron device manager for projects and devices 
  - This is a runner for the manager. It will not be released due to copyright issues. 
- myip: Get your internal/public IP address.
- nagios: Scraper for Nagios device statuses
- repeatcmd: Run a command repeatedly with a delay
- trim: Trim trailing linebreaks from a file.
