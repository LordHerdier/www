In case you didn't read my [about page](/about), I'm actually a system administrator for classroom equipment at a medium-sized university. We have a bit over a thousand network devices across the campus, with around half of them being made by Crestron. If you're not familiar with Crestron, they're one of the biggest names in commercial and residential AV installations, and have a wide array of devices that can be used in anything from a small conference room to a stadium.
At my university, we primarily use Crestron systems to control the classroom equipment that faculty members will use to teach (controlling projectors, sources, shades, etc.). We also have a few systems from other vendors, but not enough to worth mentioning at the moment.

While Crestron does have some tooling to manage a large number of devices (Fusion, XIOCloud, VC4-Server to an extent), they are often paid per device and are unfortunately quite limited in functionality. *Looking at you, Fusion.* This leaves system administrators to come up with their own solutions.

# GUI-Based Configuration Tools
I think the majority of Crestron admins rely on the standard GUI tooling provided to them. These generally have some pretty good offerings, and are great for quick configuration of individual devices. 

## Toolbox
One of the main staples of Crestron device management is *Crestron Toolbox*, a windows application that contains a multitude of different tools that can be used to configure most of Crestron's devices. It has built-in support for uploading programs to devices, updating firmware, pulling logs, configuring networking, and a ton more. The only downside is that it's a bit clunky, and can be slow as hell depending on what you're doing. Though, for the majority of administrators, this is all you're going to need.

Toolbox is a program that I have a love-hate relationship with. On one hand, it's absolutely essential to manage my devices, and there are a lot of functions that can only be changed through Toolbox  (at least easily). On the other, it's a program primarily designed for managing a single device at a time, and can be slow even with that. This would be fine if I only had maybe a couple dozen devices, but it quickly gets to be unwieldy once you start scaling up. Good luck updating the firmware for 200 touch panels through Toolbox.

## Webconf
The other main configuration tool that most Crestron admins will use is the built-in web interfaces found on most of Crestron's devices, assuming it hasn't been disabled for security. Most basic configuration can be done through this web page, such as changing network settings, performing updates, and configuring input/output routings. Though limited, these pages are fantastic for your less technically-inclined team members to make basic changes. Apart from basic configuration, I personally don't tend to use these pages very often.

One nice part about the web configuration pages is that they offer import/export of config files, which lets you quicky copy a existing device's settings when provisioning a new one (or make backups of your configuration if you don't trust your junior admins).

## XIOCloud
This is where we start to get into tools to manage larger numbers of devices, and no list would be complete without Crestron's own XIOCloud, a *cloud based* monitoring and configuration suite for most Crestron devices. If you work in an environment with more than fifty Crestron devices, you're likely pretty familiar with it.

XIOCloud lets you configure devices, upload programs, update firmware, manage licenses, and quite a bit more. Combined with being simple to add devices and use, it's definitely one of the better options for managing large numbers of Crestron equipment. It even works across multiple deployment locations, as it is hosted in the cloud.

The downside of XIOCloud is that it's a paid service from Crestron, and depending on your situation using a cloud hosted platform is not feasible for some environments (like mine). Budgeting is always a concern in the university sphere, so using expensive cloud infrastructure is not always possible.
