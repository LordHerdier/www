# Howdy, I'm Charlotte! ðŸ¤ 

I'm a systems administrator and homelab enthusiast from the United States.

Feel free to have a poke around my site and see what I'm up to!

## About Me âœ¨

Hi, Iâ€™m Charlotteâ€”SIUEâ€™s go-to sysadmin wrangling 1,000+ devices by day and coaxing ancient PCs and VPSes into my homelab madness by night. Off-duty, I roll D20s in D&D, serenade my walls with clarinet tunes, and crochet cozy blankets and plushies. Read the full about me â†’ [here](/about).
